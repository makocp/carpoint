#### Learnings

- Markdown Preview in Studio -> easy, enable .md
- Git Creating and connecting project
- Git Merge conflicts, rebase, working in team
- Jetpack Compose - Async / Declarative Programming
  - This was one of the most challenging parts, to get, how the program thinks.
  - We are surely not experts in this, but we sure have gotten some good experience.
- Testing
  - We got the idea (unfortunately at the end), that we write and implement tests for our code. This would surely helped us.
- ChatGPT
  - This tool is very helpful to get some ideas for problems.
  - We would not suggest to use it for code generating, because it wastes a lot of time.
  - One of the most important helps by ChatGPT is, that you can get a quite good explanation of the code you provide.

#### Fazit
We really liked to work with Jetpack Compose. It was a challenging task, especially for our first project with this framework, but we are satisfied with the result.

Our initial plan with implementing more features like a news feed, etc. are not realised yet, because the features now already took a lot of time to implement.
There are always things to do and we hope we fullfilled all requirements.
